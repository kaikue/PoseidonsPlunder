===Windows Instructions===
This game uses networked multiplayer. You will need to host a server on some machine, then connect to it with at least one client. Use the command line to run the executables.
Port 9000 works well for this game.

To host server:
server.exe <port>

To run client:
client.exe <host> <port>

Port should be the same on host and client. Host address can be found with the "ipconfig" command on the server machine, or just use "localhost" if the client and server are the same machine.
